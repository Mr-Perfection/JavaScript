# Welcome to my JavaScript Repo!

"Do. Or do not. There is no try"

**Learn JavaScript with my notes, applications, and demos.**

## JavaScriptES6
Cheatsheet for new JS version (introduction of new functionalities)

## Webpack
Replace Gulp/Grunt plugins with a single tool

## ReactJS
This React JS will help you get quickly up to pace with React.js development. React is an AMAZING Javascript framework that allows you to build extremely stable applications that are very easy to change and modify as the application changes and grows over time.
React is an AMAZING Javascript library (some argue, is a framework) that allows you to build extremely stable applications that are very easy to change and modify as the application changes and grows over time. I will be building several front-end applications in React to learn more about React.js. My ultimate goal is to build a React Native app for mobile platforms.


## React-Native (COMING SOON)
I will be building mobile apps in the future...
