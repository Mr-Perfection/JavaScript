React is an AMAZING Javascript library (some argue, is a framework) that allows you to build extremely stable applications that are very easy to change and modify as the application changes and grows over time. I will be building several front-end applications in React to learn more about React.js. My ultimate goal is to build a React Native app for mobile platforms.


## Full-Stack (COMING SOON)
I will be building Full-Stack JS in the future...
