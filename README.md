# JavaScript
Learning JavaScript with my notes

## JavaScriptES6
Cheatsheet for new JS version (introduction of new functionalities)

## Webpack
Replace Gulp/Grunt plugins with a single tool

## ReactJS
React is an AMAZING Javascript library (some argue, is a framework) that allows you to build extremely stable applications that are very easy to change and modify as the application changes and grows over time. I will be building several front-end applications in React to learn more about React.js. My ultimate goal is to build a React Native app for mobile platforms.


## Full-Stack (COMING SOON)
I will be building Full-Stack JS in the future...
