# Annyeong (Hello) React

**I haven't touched React (because of algorithm practices) for awhile so this is more like a review.**


## Getting started

```
$ npm init
$ npm install express@4 --save #'--save' saves express into package.json
$ npm install # if express is not part of package.json
```
```js
// tell which server to serve
// which folder name to expose to the public
app.use(express.static('public'));

```
