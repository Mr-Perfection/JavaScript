# Welcome to my auth Repo!
"Make the most out of every moment."

I built a simple authentication using Firebase

![alt text](demo/intro.png "intro")

# Getting started!

## Setup
```
$ react-native init auth
$ react

```

## Components
* Modularize components: Header, Card/CardSection, LoginForm, Button, Spinner, Input
* Create ```index.js``` from ```./src/components/``` to modularize the import statements which can be used by common root component.
* Use spinner to interact with User that the app is loading.
