# Welcome to my auth Repo!
"Make the most out of every moment."

I built a simple authentication using Firebase

# Getting started!

## Setup
```
$ react-native init auth

```

## Components
* Header, Card/CardSection, LoginForm, Button
* Create ```index.js``` from ```./src/components/``` to modularize the import statements which can be used by common root component.
