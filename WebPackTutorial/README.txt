# Webpack Tutorial
(require.js, webpack, etc)
Webpack has quickly become one of the most popular choices among web developer build tools.
It can quickly build, minify, split & do a whole wonder of other things to your code.

## Getting started

```
$ mkdir module-loaders
$ npm init
$ touch module{1..2}.js scripts.js index.html
$ npm install webpack -S #save it locally
$ touch webpack.config.js #add sample webpack code
$ webpack
$ NODE_ENV=production webpack #following the production config. (i.e. one line minification)
$ open index.html #with chrome
$ npm install -S jquery
$ npm install -S lodash
$ webpack
```
